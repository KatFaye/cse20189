The development and widespread use of
computer technology and the internet have
transformed how we communicate, how
business is conducted, how information is
dispersed, and how society is organized.
Prior to approximately 1980, in-depth
information about any one subject matter was
attained through laborious research involving
countless visits to libraries and via repeated
interviews with persons of known reputation
and reputable expertise. Now, a great deal of
information is available at the click of a
mouse button, all attainable from within the
confines of ones own home or from the use
of a computer in an office. Previous laborintensive
support jobs, such as loading and
unpacking of trucks, luggage handling at
airports, and food manufacturing, once
performed by a large middle-class workforce,
are now performed routinely by robots which
are monitored by computer-controlled
systems.
Our lives have been simplified by the advent
of computer and internet technologies, but
likewise these benefits which have been
ushered in by the technology revolution have
had an averse affect on the core of our
interpersonal-relationships. Mere
communication is no longer via postal mail
or face-to-face contact, but rather via
electronic email, personal internet message
boards, and by virtue of hand-held personal
electronic assistants. Although computer
technology has brought us to within a mouseclick
of any sought-after piece of
information, this technology boom has
sequestered us to the confines of our
computer desks and homes and has removed
us away from those traditional settings were
personal and communication skills are
developed.
