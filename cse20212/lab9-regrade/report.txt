Lab 9 Report
============

Although this is a regrade, I was not able to finish the Binary Tree portion of the Lab.

FOr the NDVector class, vector functionalities were implemented with an array as the underlying storage container, with dynamically allocated memory used to implement the various push_back() and other traditional vector functionalities.

The NDVector was then used as a replacement for the deque that was originally used in the CardDeck.h class, with modifications to the code as needed. This can all be run from the driver program.
